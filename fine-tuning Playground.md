 - Data Sources section 
  - use all area in the section for file names, do not use a scrollbar
  - restructure the files cards  to use the space more efficiently by adding expand/collapse functionality for file names, removing "Auto-deteced headers" text
  - "delete" button to remove file is not working
  - after deleting file, the file is not removed from the "Data Preview" section
  - when we add files we are getting a popup with a message "Successfully imported "n" files" and user have to click "OK" to close the popup and load the files in the "Data Preview" section - this needed to be removed, files should be loaded automatically without any popup

  
 - Workflow Builder section
  - enable "undo" and "redo" buttons
  - enable "save" button
  - enable "clear" button
  - enable "mode" button
  - enable "new" button
  - enable "custom" button
  - enable "workflow" button
  - "Drag to reorder" feature is not working
  - "Workflow Step" should be editable, but the edit button is not working
  - rework on UI for column selection, just like we did for selected formulas (eg. Upper)
  - formulas should not be limited to one column, it should be possible to select multiple columns
  - smart parameter management should be implemented, used needs not to learn formulas structure, we need to automatically detect the parameters and fill them in the input fields
  - we can use checkboxes, multiple selection, or Single Select dropdown to select the parameters
  - restructure the "Formula card" in "workflow builder" section, to use the space more efficiently

 - Formula Engine section
  - add "category-view": view - where formulas are organized by categories with expand/collapse functionality
  - add "detailed-view": mode - where formulas are displayed in a detailed view with all details
  - add "normal-view": mode - where formulas are displayed in a normal view with only the formula name
  - add "toggle-buttons": to toggle between views - categories, detailed, normal - could be a dropdown or a toggle button
  - add "sort-by": Name, Usage Count, Category, Favorites (Favourites first, then usage count) - should be dropdown menu
  - add "search": search by formula name, description, category, alias 

 - Data Preview section
  - add a placeholder or a loading spinner when files are being loaded
  - Remove "Select File" Button, select the entire file if user click on sheet/file nname in Data Preview section

 - Live Preview section
  - if "Final Result" is selected, show results of all steps combined, number of columns should be proportional to the number of steps in the workflow
